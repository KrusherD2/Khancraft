"2Words make a wonderful interface. Very flexible. And less terrifying than staring at the reality behind the scratchpad.",
"1They used to hear voices. Before we removed sound. Back in the days when those who did not play called the players witches, and warlocks. And players dreamed they flew through the air, on sticks powered by demons.",
"2What did this player dream?",
"1This player dreamed of sunlight and trees. Of fire and water. It dreamed it created. And it dreamed it destroyed. It dreamed it hunted, and was hunted. It dreamed of shelter.",
"2Hah, the original interface. A million years old, and it still works. But what true structure did this player created, in the reality behind the scratchpad?",
"1It worked, with a million others, to sculpt a true world in a fold of the iV3L93iI, and created a 3Ih1L7Ef for Fe4z98F, in the F38hJ4i.",

"1No. It has not yet achieved the highest level. That, it must achieve in the long dream of life, not the short dream of a program.",
"2Does it know that we love it? That the universe is kind?",
"1Sometimes, through the noise of its thoughts, it hears the universe, yes.",
"2But there are times it is sad, in the long dream. It creates worlds that have no summer, and it shivers under a black sun, and it takes its sad creation for reality.",
"1To cure it of sorrow would destroy it. The sorrow is part of its own private task. We cannot interfere.",
"2Sometimes when they are deep in dreams, I want to tell them, they are building true worlds in reality. Sometimes I want to tell them of their importance to the universe. Sometimes, when they have not made a true connection in a while, I want to help them to speak the word they fear.",

"2We are the universe. We are everything you think isn't you. You are looking at us now, through your skin and your eyes. And why does the universe touch your skin, and throw light on you? To see you, player. To know you. And to be known. I shall tell you a story.",
"2Once upon a time, there was a player.",
"1That player was you, "+username+".",
"2Sometimes it thought itself human, on the thin crust of a spinning globe of molten rock. The ball of molten rock circled a ball of blazing gas that was three hundred and thirty thousand times more massive than it. They were so far apart that light took eight minutes to cross the gap. The light was information from a star, and it could burn your skin from a hundred and fifty million kilometres away.",
"2Sometimes the player dreamed it was a miner, on the surface of a world that was flat, and infinite. The sun was a square of white. The days were short; there was much to do; and death was a temporary inconvenience.",
"1Sometimes the player dreamed it was lost in a story.",
"2Sometimes the player dreamed it was other things, in other places. Sometimes these dreams were disturbing. Sometimes very beautiful indeed. Sometimes the player woke from one dream into another, then woke from that into a third.",
"1Sometimes the player dreamed it watched words in a scratchpad.",
"2Let's go back.",
"2The atoms of the player were scattered in the grass, in the rivers, in the air, in the ground. A woman gathered the atoms; she drank and ate and inhaled; and the woman assembled the player, in her body.",
"2And the player awoke, from the warm, dark world of its mother's body, into the long dream.",
"2And the player was a new story, never told before, written in letters of DNA. And the player was a new program, never run before, generated by a sourcecode a billion years old. And the player was a new human, never alive before, made from nothing but milk and love.",
